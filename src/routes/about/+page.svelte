<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
After studying at The College of New Jersey with a double major in Fine Arts and
Chinese, I moved to Montréal (Tiohtiá:ke) to further pursue education at Concordia
University with a specialization in Drawing & Painting. Now, after finishing my degree
this past May, I’ve found myself more inspired than before, with hopes to evoke emotions
in viewers and reach a larger audience.

<h2>ABOUT MY WORK</h2>

Expressive of my own thoughts, experiences, and emotions, my art encapsulates
many aspects of my being. Though I am the main audience I direct my art towards,
a common theme in my work is to create a space where many can identify a part of
themselves, while still keeping it personal and authentic to who I am. I’m
mainly intrigued by iconography and sign usage; pairing old with new. The road
signs are set in a new context- one that is no longer quickly understood by the
masses. My works require knowledge in art history, religion, and my distinct
experiences to create a unique story that can be known but isn’t a necessity. I
wish for my audience to appreciate the artworks for their composition and color
usage regardless of its concept.
